# Landing Page Project

 A landing page for **edX front end software development bootcamp**.
 This is week one assignment: Designing and build a simple landing page using HTML and style it using CSS.


## Description

Here is a short overview of the project

### What the project does

This is a simple landing page which users can make enquiry about the ongoing edX Front end development bootcamp. Users can fill out a `contact form` and submit a message for review.
The page has a fixed `navigation bar` with menu which links to the social media links in the `footer` and a contact menu which directs user straight to the contact form to submit and enquiry
